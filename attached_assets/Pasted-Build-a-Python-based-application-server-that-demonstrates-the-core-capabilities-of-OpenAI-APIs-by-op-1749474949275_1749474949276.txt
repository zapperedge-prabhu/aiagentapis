Build a Python based application server that demonstrates the core capabilities of OpenAI APIs by operating on files stored in Azure Blob Storage. This platform will serve as a showcase of AI agent capabilities such as summarization, sentiment analysis, document Q&A, keyword extraction, and translation this is REST APIs repo, no frontend required.

following is storage account connection string 
DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=storagetest12344;AccountKey=lqsllsU65jg1xYs8Wlu3CIvIrwPu8vAbnuWR6cZrm3pH0Qt7aFJid+NYR7CGvGfzitYLOPP7yxwm+AStxmNhwA==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net

and OpenAI API key is

The app will read files directly from blob URLs or paths

AI Agent Capabilities (APIs to Develop)
API Name	Description	OpenAI Feature Used	Input	Output
/summarize	Summarizes a document into a short paragraph	GPT (ChatCompletion)	File	Text Summary
/sentiment	Analyzes the tone/sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)	GPT (ChatCompletion)	File	Sentiment label + explanation
/extract-keywords	Extracts important keywords from document	GPT (ChatCompletion)	File	List of keywords
/translate	Translates file content to another language (e.g., English to Hindi)	GPT (ChatCompletion)	File + target language	Translated text
/structure-data	Extracts structured data (e.g., name, date, amount)	GPT (ChatCompletion with few-shot examples)	File	JSON of key fields
/detect-topics	Identifies the primary topics discussed in the document	GPT (ChatCompletion)	File	List of topics


Each API will have have its own API_KEY

something like below
# API Keys for individual endpoints
    API_KEYS = {
        "/summarize":  "summarize-key-123"),
        "/sentiment":  "sentiment-key-123"),
        "/extract-keywords":  "keywords-key-123"),
        "/translate":  "translate-key-123"),
        "/structure-data": "structure-key-123"),
        "/detect-topics":  "topics-key-123"),
    }
